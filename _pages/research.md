My current research mainly centers around mathematical methods for control of density-based systems. These could be densities of particles immersed in a fluid, probability densities arising from stochastic processes, or density approximations of very-large-scale systems. Analyzing and manipulating these sorts of systems is challenging because they are typically nonlinear and have an infinite number of degrees of freedom. My research aims to develop mathematical methods which leverage structure in these systems to make their analysis and control more tractable.

Below is a short description of current and past research projects. Publications are listed under the project they are associated with. All publications can be found on my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CN7oYBQAAAAJ&hl=en).

Boundary-Layer Data Systems
----------
My undergraduate research focused on designing mechatronic devices for making real-time measurements of boundary layers on aircraft. These devices were designed to fit in low-profile, adhesive-mountable, and fully self-contained packages while maintaining high accuracy in the extreme environments encountered at altitude. I worked on three devices during my tenure in the lab: the "Pressurewing-I" and "Pressurewing-II", multi-sensors built on Adafruit's Feather platform, providing up to ten independent boundary layer measurements in addition to temperature/pressure/altitude/etc., and the "BLDS-T", a large-scale distributed temperture-sensor network for thermal mapping.
