I have over ten years of experience teaching in various forms: as a TA (both at Cal Poly and at UCSB), as an instructor, as a personal tutor, and as a swim instructor for children of all ages and abilities. Over the years, I have taught numerous subjects, including vibrations, controls, mechatronics, robotics, dynamical systems, nonlinear differential equations, electricity and magnetism, mechanics of materials, manufacturing, and design for test automation. In the Fall of 2024, I had the opportunity to develop and teach (as instructor of record) ME 500, a brand-new TA training course in the UCSB Mechanical Engineering Department.

My academic teaching largely emphasizes what I see as the “keys to the kingdom” of science: curiosity, creative problem-solving, self-directed learning, agency over the subject matter, and a view of science as a model and tool for understanding and manipulating the world around us. I try to connect the material that students are learning to real-world problems, lead them to discover ideas for themselves, and encourage them to ask questions as well as to try and answer questions for themselves. So often I think we teach in this very rigid way where a subject is treated as absolute truth with a set of facts which students are expected to memorize. For students who are used to learning in this more traditional style, I think this different approach can be somewhat of a revelation and can fundamentally change the way that they relate to science, research, and education.

Below is a list of courses I have recently taught or TA'd for.
