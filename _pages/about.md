I am a PhD candidate at the Univeristy of California Santa Barbara specializing in dynamical systems, control theory, and applied mathematics. My current research focuses on optimal control of density-based systems, with applications in fluid and stochastic systems and swarm robotics.

I obtained my BS in Mechanical Engineering from California Polytechnic State Univeristy San Luis Obispo in 2020. During this time, I worked in the Flight Test Data System (FTDS) Lab under the supervision of [Dr. Russel Westphal](https://me.calpoly.edu/faculty/rvwestph/). I obtained my MS in Mechanical Engineering from the University of California Santa Barbara in 2022 in the Dynamics and Controls Lab under the supervision of [Dr. Bassam Bamieh](https://sites.engineering.ucsb.edu/~bamieh/).

I have completed industry internships both with Tesla in Fremont, CA, and with Panasonic Avionics in Bothell, WA.
