I am currently a PhD candidate at the Univeristy of California Santa Barbara specializing in dyanical systems, control theory, and applied mathematics. My current research focuses on optimal control of density-based systems, with applications in fluids, stochastics, and swarm robotics.

I obtained my BS in Mechanical Engineering from California Polytechnic State Univeristy San Luis Obispo. During this time, I worked in the Flight Test Data System (FTDS) Lab under the supervision Dr. Russel Westphal. I obtained my MS in Mechanical Engineering from the University of California Santa Barbara in the Dynamics and Controls Lab under the supervision of Dr. Bassam Bamieh.

I have done industry internships with Tesla in Fremont, CA, and Panasonic Avionics Corporation in Bothell, WA.
